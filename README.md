# PixDrop (Frontend)
Modern, elegant photo uploader for events. Drag & drop, paste, camera capture, client-side compression, simple sharing via QR. Ready to connect to Google Drive or your own S3/R2 backend.

## Quick Start
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Configure
- Set `VITE_API_BASE` in `.env` when your backend is ready.
- For demo, the app fakes success and points to a dummy Drive link.

## Deploy (Vercel recommended)
1. Push this repo to GitHub
2. Import to Vercel
3. Set Environment Variable: `VITE_API_BASE` (optional for demo)
4. Attach your domain `pixdrop.cloud`

## Backend Contract (expected)
`POST /upload` (multipart/form-data)
- file: Blob (image), folderId: string
- optional: weddingCode, uploaderName
- returns: `{ id, name, webViewLink? }`

## Built-in Backend (Node + Google Drive)
A minimal Express server lives in the `server/` directory. It can upload
files to a Google Drive folder or, if no credentials are provided, fall back
to saving them on the local filesystem.

### Setup
1. Create a Google Cloud service account and enable the Drive API.
2. Download the service-account JSON file.
3. Create a folder on your Drive, note its ID and share it with the service account.
4. Export environment variables (or place them in `server/.env`):
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT="$(cat /path/to/credentials.json)"
   export DRIVE_FOLDER_ID="<your-root-folder-id>"
   # optionally: export PORT=3001
   ```
5. Install deps and start the server:

```
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

Set `VITE_API_BASE` in the frontend to point to this server.

### Event Admin & Subdomains
1. Visit `/admin` on the frontend to create events.
2. Each event needs a unique `slug` (used as the subdomain) and a Drive folder ID.
3. Uploads sent to `slug.example.com` will go to that event's Drive folder.
4. Configure a wildcard DNS record (`*.pixdrop.cloud`) pointing to your host so subdomains resolve.

## Own Drive (S3/R2)
Use presigned uploads:
- `POST /sign-upload` â†’ returns `{ uploadUrl, key }`
- Frontend PUTs the file to `uploadUrl`
- Serve via CDN: `https://cdn.pixdrop.cloud/{key}`
